single-page server & client application

serverside:
- golang
- using echo mini web framework

clientside:
- basically a copy of es6-react-webpack

The general concept was copied from go-starter-kit, but this is much more minimal.

TODO:
- add toplevel build, watch, bundle commands
- add binary bundling into go binary
- add fetch example into API
-
